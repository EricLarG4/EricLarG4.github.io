Definitions\r\n1.1 G-quadruplex\r\n1.2 Quartets and derivatives\r\n1.3 Beyond the G4 core: loops, bulges, and flanking sequences\r\n1.4 Loop types\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Definitions\r\nIn the following section, minimal definitions of terms specific to the field are proposed to ensure a better consistency in describing G-quadruplex structures across publications.\r\n1.1 G-quadruplex\r\nG-quadruplex (abbrev.: G4): Secondary structure formed by the association of a minimum of two G-quartets by \\(\\pi\\)-\\(\\pi\\) stacking and coordination to a cation (Figure 1, left). The term G-quadruplex encompasses a variety of conformations differing by their number of G-quartets, loop length and geometry, relative orientation of the G-tract strands, molecularity, and other non-canonical features (e.g. mixed quartets, extended quartets such as hexads or heptads, and additional features including triplets, base pairs or bulges). G-quadruplexes may be formed from nucleic acid having either natural (DNA, RNA) or artificial (e.g. PNA, LNA) backbones.\r\nTetraplex: Alternative name for G-quadruplex. Not recommended to use it to avoid confusions with other uses of the word (e.g. tetraplex PCR assay). Tetraplex should not be used to imply a tetra-stranded stoichiometry; preferred wording should be: tetramolecular G-quadruplex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: The G-quadruplex and i-motif cores. Both are formed by stacking of different building blocks, respectively the G-quartet and the hemi-protonated cytosine base pair for the i-motif. The phosphate backbone is shown as a line. Guanines and cytosines are depicted by an orange or blue circle, respectively, and a cuboid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZ-G4: Left-handed G-quadruplex, named by analogy with Z-DNA left-handed double helices (DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1418718112).\r\ni-motifs (or i-DNA) are structures formed at slightly acidic pH by cytosine-rich nucleic acids, characterized by C•CH+ base pairs arranged in two parallel duplexes associated head-to-tail via base-pair intercalation (Figure 1, right). Although these double duplexes can be considered as a type of quadruplex structure, they will not be discussed further herein.z`z\r\n1.2 Quartets and derivatives\r\nG-quartet: Quasi co-planar association of four guanines linked by a network of eight hydrogen bonds on both the Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen faces (i.e. N2H·N7 and N1H·O6) (Figure 2A). They are also frequently called quartets or tetrads, although these terms are less specific and should preferably be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Chemical structures of the G-quartet (A), G·C·G·C (B; DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkp630), G·G·G·T (C; DOI: 10.1021/bi0355185) and G·G·G·A (D; DOI: 10.1021/bi0355185) mixed quartets, G·G·G G-triplet (E; DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkp1029), and A·G·A mixed triplet (F; DOI: 10.1093/nar/gkp1029).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nG-tract: Part of a nucleic sequence consisting of a minimum of two consecutive guanines, which may be involved in the formation of G-quartets (Figure 3). G-tracts involved in G-quartet formation can be interrupted by bulges or snapbacks, and linked to another G-tract by a loop (see section 1.3). A minimum of four G-tracts are necessary to form a G-quadruplex, whether they are contained in a single strand or in up to four different strands.\r\nStem: Consecutively stacked guanines involved in G-quartet formation. There are four stems per core.\r\nMixed quartet: Quartet of bases not entirely formed by guanines, e.g. G·C·G·C, G·G·G·T and G·C·G·A (Figure 2B—D).\r\nTriplet (or triad): By analogy with the quartet, quasi co-planar association of three bases. It can be composed of guanines exclusively (G-triplet; Figure 2E) or mixed (Figure 2F).\r\nBase pair: Association of two nucleotides by hydrogen bonding of the bases; not limited to Watson-Crick pairing. Although not typically associated with G-quadruplexes, base pairs can be formed by loop and flanking sequence nucleotides, and are sometimes stacked upon the core, hence contributing to the G4 stabilization.\r\nCore: Structural ensemble of consecutively stacked quartets and their inner cations (Figure 1). Sometimes called subunits in the context of stacked or interlocked multimers (see section 1.8).\r\nInner cation: In the particular context of G-quadruplexes, cation bound by the O6 of G-quartets guanines (or related structures, vide supra) (Figures 1 and 2A). Depending on a number of factors including the cation ionic radius and lone pair attraction, cation-cation repulsion, and possible G-quartet distortion, it may be located anywhere from within a G-quartet’s plane to – more commonly – midway between two G-quartets, as typically observed for potassium (DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-21756-7).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: G-quadruplex features beyond the core (A), loop geometries (B), and snapback (C). The phosphate backbone is shown as a line and guanines are depicted by an orange circle and a cuboid in either syn (dark gray) or anti (light gray) conformation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.3 Beyond the G4 core: loops, bulges, and flanking sequences\r\nLoop: Part of the nucleic acid sequence linking G-tracts involved in G-quartet formation (Figure 3B). Loops can adopt different geometries (see section 1.4). Loop nucleotides may be base-paired.\r\nBulge: Part of a sequence interrupting a G-tract involved in G-quartet formation, i.e. nucleotides linking two guanines implicated in two consecutively stacked G-quartets (Figure 3A).\r\nFlanking sequence: Nucleotides from the 5’- and 3’-termini of a G-quadruplex positioned before the first or after the last G-quartet forming guanine, respectively (Figure 3A). Flanking sequence nucleotides may be base-paired. Although not part of the core, flanking sequences can have a large impact on the topology and multimerization of G-quadruplexes (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.5b13130). Flanking sequences are naturally present in the genomic context.\r\n1.4 Loop types\r\nPropeller (or chain reversal): loop spanning across G-quartets to connect guanines from two different quartets so that the two linked G-tracts are adjacent and share the same 5’-3’ polarity (parallel) (Figure 3B). Parallel loops typically contain 1—2 nucleotides.\r\nV-shaped: Variant of the propeller loop that does not contain any nucleotide, so that the two G-tracts are directly connected.\r\nLateral or edgewise: loop connecting two adjacent G-tracts of opposite 5’-3’ polarity (antiparallel) (Figure 3B). Lateral loops typically contain at least 2—3 nucleotides depending on the groove width.\r\nDiagonal: loop linking diagonally opposed G-tracts of opposite 5’-3’ polarity (antiparallel) (Figure 3B). Diagonal loops typically contain at least 3 nucleotides.\r\nSnapback: Loop that connects an external quartet to an internal quartet., instead of linking two external quartets as more commonly observed. This means that one stem of consecutively stacked guanines is composed of two distinct G-tracts (Figure 3C) (DOI: 10.1021/ja068739h). This implies that the stem in question is not composed of a continuous phosphate backbone.\r\nBoth lateral and diagonal loops result in a strand polarity inversion occurring in antiparallel and hybrid topologies, whereas propeller loops preserve the same orientation and are thus found only in parallel and hybrid topologies (see section 1.6).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
